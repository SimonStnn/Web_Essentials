# Project 2 - Home Dashboard

## Case

You make a dashboard for a house.

* Provide a dashboard by means of. HTML, CSS and JS/TS.

There are 4 Shelly plugs to which devices are connected.

* You automatically add the found Shelly plugs to the dashboard.
* For each plug, a switch on/off and the current consumption are displayed.
* With the switch you can turn the plug on or off.

There are also Philips Hue lamps that are connected via a bridge.

* You automatically add the found Philips Hue lamps to the dashboard.
* A switch is displayed for each lamp with a color indication of the lamp.
* You can switch the lamp on or off via the switch.
* You can also adjust the color via a color picker.

## Elaboration

* Make visual groups of the lamps and the plugs.
* The color picker is only visible when needed.
* Use TypeScript to generate your JavaScript.
